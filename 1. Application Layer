2.2 Two structures:
 
(1) client/server
Server: 7 * 24 hours provide server
             permanent address/ domain name
             multiple servers
Client: can communicate with the server, not with other clients
              use dynamic IP address
              discontinuous linked to the server 
E.g. Web
 
(2) peer to peer
No 7 * 24 hours server
Each node can communicate with each other
use dynamic IP address
 
(3) hybrid
Napster P2P -> File Transfer
               C/S ->  File Search
 
2.3.1 HTTP (Application layer Protocol)
(1) Intro
HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)
C/S structure
Client: Browser
Server: Web Server (E.g. Apache)
TCP
Stateless 服务器不维护任何有关客户端过去所发请求的信息
优点：
1.	避免状态不一致
2.	不用存储状态
 
(2) Permanent/ Non-permanent Connection
Non-Permanent connection:
Each TCP connection can only transfer one object
(1 Type URL: www.someSchool.edu/someDepartment/home.index
(2 HTTP client sends TCP connection request to www.someSchool.edu
(3 HTTP server is waiting at port 80, receives the request, tells the client
(4 HTTP client sends HTTP request by Socket
(5 HTTP server receives the request, generates the response, closed the connection
(6 HTTP client receives the response, decode the file (html, jpg…), display the file
Repeat 1 - 6 if there are multiple objects
 
Total time = 2*RTT(Round Trip Time) + File Transfer Time
 
Disadvantages:
(1 Each object needs 2 RTTs
(2 Overhead for OS
 
Permanent Connection:
Keep TCP connection open
Pipelining/ Non-pipelining (http 1.1)
 
2.3.2 Message
(1 Request
GET /somedir/page.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.someschool.edu (useful while using cache or proxy servers)
User-agent: Mozilla/ 4.0
Connection: close
Accept-language: fr
 
How to upload input from browser to server?
(1 POST method (form)
The input message is in the entity body
(2 GET method (url)
The input message is in the URL
E.g. www.someschool.edu/delete?1
 
(2 Response
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Connection: close
Date: Thu, 06 Aug 1998 12:00:15 GMT （Web server 生成消息的时间）
Server: Apache/1.3.0 (Unix)
Last-Modified: Mon, 22 Jun 1998 （网页上次修改时间）
Content-Length: 6821
Content-Type: text/html
 
HTTP response status code:
200 OK
301 Moved Permanently
304 Not Modified
400 Bad Request
404 Not Found
505 HTTP Version Not Supported
 
2.3.3 Cookie (extension tech)
Need status (e.g. online shopping)
为辨别用户身份、进行session跟踪而存储在用户本地终端上的数据
 
(1 Composition
HTTP response message cookie header line
HTTP request
Cookie file on the server client, managed by the web server
Web server backend database
 
(2 Process
 
 
 
(3 Functions
Id verification
Shopping cart
Recommendation
Web e-mail
 
(4 Disadvantages
Private
 
2.3.4 Proxy Server
(1) What is Proxy Server?
 
 
 
(2) How proxy server works?
If the access link is 1.5 Mbps, the LAN is 10 Mbps.
There are 15 requests sending to the original server per second
LAN utility rate = 15%
Link layer utility rate = 100%
The prorogation delay will be extremely high.
 
Solution 1: Increase the access link (Expensive)
 
Solution 2: Add a proxy server
Assume 40% requests can be satisfied immediately. (No need to send to the original server. Just get from the proxy server)
LAN utility rate = 40%
Link layer utility rate = 60%
The prorogation delay will be low.
 
(3) How to ensure the context of the proxy server is align with that of the original server?
Conditional GET
If the cache has the up-to-date version (Compare with If-Modified-Since(Date))
the original server sends HTTP/1.0 304 Not Modified.
Otherwise, If-Modified-Since: <data>
 
2.4 E-mail
(1) Components
(1 Mail Server
Store the e-mails sent to the user
Store the e-mails to be sending to other users (message queue)
 
Advantages:
Receive e-mails when the PC is not connected to the Internet.
Ensure the e-mails send to the targets correctly. (Help us resend e-mails if fails)
 
(2 SMTP Protocol
Permanent connection
 
Comparation with HTTP:
Same: ASCII,  Command/Response
Difference: HTTP pull
SMTP push
 
2.5 DNS
Domain name -> IP Address
 
(1) Distributed Hierarchical database
                              Root DNS Servers
 
Com DNS servers  org DNS Servers  edu DNS servers 
             |                                |                             |
……
 
E.g. Search IP of www.amazon.com
(1 Search Root DNS Server, find the com DNS server
(2 Search com DNS Server, find the amazon.com DNS server
(3 Search amazon.com DNS server, get the IP of www.amazon.com
 
Disadvantage: Root DNS Server's workload is too heavy.
 
Solution: Add local DNS server
Disadvantage: Root DNS Server's workload is also too heavy.
 
(1 Recursion
Requesting host -> local DNS server -> root DNS server -> TLD DNS server
-> authoritative DNS server -> TLD DNS server -> root DNS server -> local DNS server
-> requesting host
 
Disadvantage: Root DNS Server's workload is also too heavy.
 
(2 Iterative
Requesting host -> local DNS server -> root DNS server -> local DNS server
-> TLD DNS server -> local DNS server -> authoritative DNS server -> local DNS server
-> requesting host
 
(2) DNS cache and renew
Delete after a period
Store the mapping of top-domain server (Root DNS server is not visited often)
 
2.6 P2P
 
(1) File Distribution:
 
 
 
 
P2P is faster than C/S in file distribution.
 
BitTorrent: Tit-for-tat
Higher speed, better trade friend.
 
(2) index technology
The mapping between information and IP address + port number
 
(1 Application
1 File sharing
2 QQ, Skype(Hierarchical overlap network)
 
(2 Type
1 Centralized index
Centralized directory server
节点加入时通知cds，cds保存节点的ip和内容
其他节点向cds请求所查找内容的节点位置
其他节点向存有内容的节点请求内容
 
Disadvantages：
1.单点失效（cds挂了）
2.性能瓶颈（cds负荷大）
3.版权
 
2 Query flooding
Each node only index its own sharing files.
Overlay network: Graph
The query is sent by TCP connection.
Each node transfers the query.
If the file is hit, return the file by the reversed path.
Query flooding will cost a lot of bandwidths, leading to network congestion.
 
3 Hierarchical overlap network
 
Group-leader peer <=> cds + transfer queries
