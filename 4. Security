6.1 Intro
What is network security?
(1) confidentiality: 
only sender and receiver can understand message
sender encrypt message
receiver decrpt message
(2) authentication
confirm identity of each other
(3) message integrity
send, receive good data
(4) access and availability
Target users can access to web service
 
6.2 Threaten
What bad guys will do?
(1) eavesdrop
(2) insert
(3) impersonation
(4) hijacking
(5) denial of service
E.g. by overloading bandwidth/ resources
Solution: SYN cookie
Seq = y = Hash(source IP, dest IP, source port, dest port, random number)
 
Mapping (eavesdrop)
Case the joint
Ping
Port-scanning: try to build TCP connection with each port
Solution: record flow
 
Segment sniffing (eavesdrop)
solution:  Running the same software
 
IP Spoofing (impersonation)
solution: Ingress filtering
 
6.3 cryptograph
6.3.1 Intro
Model 1:
 
Trudy may know encryption algorithm and decryption algorithm.
But she must not know the encryption key and the decryption key.
 
Model 2:
 
Trudy may know encryption algorithm, decryption algorithm, and public key.
But she must not know the private key.
 
Decode ways:
(1) cipher-text only attack
(1 brute force
(2 statistical analysis
The frequency of each alphabet
 
(2) known-plaintext attack
Monoalphabetic cipher
 
(3) chosen-plaintext attack
 
6.3.2 traditional encryption
(1) substitution cipher: 用一种东西替代另一种东西
I love you -> n etox dhz
(2) transpositions cipher: permutation method
I love you -> ilov eyou -> lvio yueo
 
6.3.3 modern encryption
Not target on alphabet, but on bit multiplication
 
(1) Balanced key encryption 
(1 stream ciphers
z = z0z1z2...
M -> ((key -> z) + XOR) -> encrypted M
Encrypted M -> ((key -> x) + XOR) -> M
 
(2 block ciphers
将明文序列划分为长为n的明文组，分块加密
E.g. DES algorithm structure
 
 
(2) Unbalanced key encryption
Public key encryption
Public key: everyone knows
Private key: only receiver knows
 
Requirement:
K-b(K+b(m)) = m
Given K+b, cannot get K-b
 
RSA
(1) N = p * q (p and q are big primes)
      pick such e and d that e * d = 2 mod (p - 1)(q - 1)
Pk = (N, e)
Sk = (N, d)
      m should be invertible
(2) encryption: m ^ e mod N = c
(3) decryption: c ^ d mod N = m
 
c ^ d mod n = (m ^ e mod n) mod n = m ^ ed mod n = m ^ (ed mod z) mod n = m mod n
 
6.4 Authentication
Target: Alice shows her identification to Bob 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Drawback: Both bob and Alice know the Ka-b.
 
 
Drawback:
 
 
6.5 message integrity
(1) What is message integrity?
(1 Prove message comes from the specific sender
(2 Check if the message is changed through transition
(3 Prevent the time and order of messages are changed
(4 Prevent the deny of sender or receiver
 
(2) Cryptographic Hash Function
 
 
(3) Common Hash Algorithm:
(1 Checksum
 
(2 MD5
(3 SHA
 
(4) Message digest
M -> H -> H(m) (message digest)
H(m) is the fingerprint of m.
 
M + H(m) -> (m, h)
M -> H -> H(m)
H(m) =? H
Drawback: cannot decide who is the sender
 
MAC(Message Authentication Code)
M + key + H -> (m, H(m + s))
Drawback: cannot decide if the sender changed the message
 
6.6 Key Distribution Center and Certification Authority
KDC (Key Distribution Center)
Alice和Bob只知道自己与kdc之间的对称密钥，分别与kdc秘密通信
 
 
Bob收到声称来自Alice的公钥，如何证明这个公钥确实来自Alice?
CA (Certification Authority)
 
 
7.1 E-mail
 
 
 
7.2 SSL
Support all the application based on TCP
Https: use SSL
 
Confidentiality
Integrity
Authentication
 
 
 
4 keys:
Kc = Client sends data to server
Mc = client sends MAC(完整性认证)  to server
Ks = server sends data to client
Ms = server sends MAC to client
 
 
Attacker catch, repeat or disorder records?
Add sequence into MAC.
 
Attacker repeat all the records?
Use nonce.
 
Attacker close TCP connection?
Add type into MAC.
 
Cipher suite:
Public key algo
Symmetric encryption algo
MAC
 
Protocol stack:
Change Cipher Spec Protocol
Alert Protocol
Handshake Protocol
Record Protocol
 
 
先建立tcp connection, 再建立ssl
先断开ssl, 再断开tcp connection
 
7.3 IP secuirity
(1) PN (Private networks)
总部网络 -> router -> 专用通道 -> router -> 分支机构网络
 
(2) VPN (Virtual Private Network)
总部网络 -> router -> 安全通道 -> router -> 分支机构网络
安全通道搭建在公共网络之上
实现技术：IPSec, SSL, L2TP
 
(3) IPSec
(1 service
Confidentiality
Data integrity
Origin authentication
Replay attack prevention
 
(2 transport model
1 Hosts are IPSec-ware: Hosts are responsible for transferring datagram.
2 Routers are IPSec-ware: Routers are responsible for transferring datagram.
 
(3 SA (security association)
IPSec是单工，面向连接的
在端到端(router and router)建立两条SA
密钥交换 IKE
 
AH/RSP 封装IPSec datagram
 
7.4 WLAN security
(1) WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy)
每个分组单独加密
 
(2) 802.11i
 
7.5 Firewall
 
Types
(1) Stateless packet filters
 
ACL (Access Control List)
 
(2) Stateful packet filters
跟踪每个tcp connection
 
(3) Application gateways
基于应用数据以及IP/TCP.UDP头部字段过滤分组
 
设置合理的安全级别
